I'm Yene, a full stack dev who loves turning ideas into tools. Always curious, always building - especially with ML, APIs, and data-driven apps.

I come from a background in chemical engineering, where I worked closely with control systems, which sparked my interest in software engineering and how complex systems are designed. Since then, I've been especially drawn to system design, cloud architecture, and building data-driven applications.

I enjoy working across the stack, exploring how everything fits together â€” from backend logic to frontend UX, and from machine learning models to cloud deployments.

I'm also into running, coffee, producing and playing and listening to music, travelling, the odd patio drink, working out, and rewatching clips from Always Sunny in Philadelphia for the 100th time. Preferably in that order.
