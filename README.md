I'm Yene, a full stack developer who loves turning ideas into tools. Always curious, always building — especially with ML, APIs, and data-driven apps.

I come from a background in chemical engineering, where I worked with control systems — that experience sparked my interest in software engineering and how complex systems are designed. Since then, I've been especially drawn to system design, cloud architecture, and building data-driven applications.

🛠️ I enjoy working across the stack, exploring how everything fits together — from backend logic to frontend UX, and from machine learning models to cloud deployments.
