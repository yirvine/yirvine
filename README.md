Hey there - I'm Yene, a full stack developer who loves turning ideas into tools. Always curious, always building — especially with ML, APIs, and data-driven apps.

I come from a background in chemical engineering, where I worked with control systems, which sparked my interest in software engineering. Since then, I've developed a strong interest in system design and building scalable, cloud-based architecture.

🛠️ I enjoy working across the stack, exploring how everything fits together — from backend logic to frontend UX, and from machine learning models to cloud deployments.
